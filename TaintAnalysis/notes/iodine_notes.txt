dynamic information-flow tracking is 
pretty much dynamic taint analysis 

".. sinks, e.g., network output"
  "... standard output interfaces, i.e., terminal, 
  file and socket outputs" 

"every instruction has to be monitored to propagate tains to the destination operand based on the source operands' taints" 

performance overhead when using DTA tools, DIFT is an improvement on that 

Iodine is a OHA (optimistic hybrid analysis)
and can "imporve the precision and scalability
of static taint analysis" 

*** mostly about optimizations to TA ***

"static taint analysis computes how the taints
of data propagate throug hthe program
under a given selection of taint sources, 
sinks, and propagation policies."
