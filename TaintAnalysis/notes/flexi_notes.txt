tainting software has "significant problems with
self-modifying code, JIT compilation, and multithreaded
applications"

hardware problems that 
"limit their [hardware tainting schemes] practicality" :
- "implementation requires non-standard commodity components and a redesign of the entire processor core"
 -- taint bits require wider memory, wider registers, wider buses and wider bypasses

- "limited flexibility in specifying taint propagation
rules and in the # of taint btis associated with a value

-- want more taint bits, gonna cost more memory

it seems tainting inputs to detect attacks is only 
one particular use of tainting....

"FlexiTaint is not a comprehensive security solution by 
itself, but rather a proof-of-concept hardware substrate
that can speed up an important class of security solutions, namely taint propagation."

"FlexiTaint can be used with any set of propagation rules in which the tiant of the result depends only on the opcode 
and the taints of the operands."

summary of disadvantages:

delays
consistency issues
"the latency of misses in the TL1 cache is fully exposed
because they stall the in-order taint processing pipeline"
