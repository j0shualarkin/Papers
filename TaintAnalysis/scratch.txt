Taint analysis is a term for a collection of techniques in tracking untrustable data
through programs. -- how this relates to SQL, XSS, BfOf

-- what paper is about 
-- applications to programming languages in general
    -- general idea from cmu paper
    -- java string libraries 
    -- ???more???
-- more look at solutions to those areas: sql, xss, bfof? 
-- slow downs and responses

Practical computer science involves both theoretical understandings and 
pragmatism for real world scenarios. There is a lot of research being done
on dependently typed languages, and there are a lot of C programs in use, handling
sensitive data. There are many problems in the realm of 
cybersecurity, software and web security in particular, that require a bit of both

Motivate taint analysis. What makes it interesting?

also known as information flow analysis

there are many ways in which this is applicable as generally it is a 
strong security strategy 

we want to talk about the main idea 

and all the ways in which it is applicable

really interesting from a PL perspective because languages can do so many 
things

rewriting string libraries 

understand code via analysis and appreciate the necessary assumptions for each line
-- important for buffer overflow vulnerabilities!
